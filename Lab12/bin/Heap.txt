Note: A tree with only a root and no other nodes has height = 0.
---------
a) If a heap contained 100 elements, what is the minimum height of the 
heap?  What is the maximum height of the heap?

The minimum height of the heap would be 6. (log2 100 = 6.6 )
The maximum height of the heap is also 6.

---------
b) How about a heap with 9765 elements?

The minimum and maximum height of the heap would be 13. (log2 9765 = 13.2)

---------
c) What is the minimum number of total elements that cause the heap 
to have larger height (than the heap has with 9765 elements?)

16,384 elements would make the tree of height 14. 

---------
d) What is the maximum number of swaps performed to do an insert into
a heap with 9765 elements?  What is the minimum number of swaps to do
that?  

The maximum number of swaps is 13.

---------
e) Given a maxHeap, how many elements need to be looked at to determine
the largest value?

Just 1. The root. 

---------
f) Given a maxHeap stored as an array, come up with an algorithm to determine the lowest value in the maxHeap.
